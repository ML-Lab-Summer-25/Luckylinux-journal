# LuckyLinux ML Journal

Welcome to my personal machine learning journal — a structured collection of notebooks, experiments, and insights as I learn and build with ML.

## 📁 Structure

The repo is organized by weekly progress:

```
C1-<Course-1-Name>/
├── Week-1/
│   └── Lab-1-<Lab-Name>.ipynb
├── Week-2/
│   └── Lab-2-<Lab-Name>.ipynb
│
C2-<Course-2-Name>/
├── Week-1/
│   └── Lab-1-<Lab-Name>.ipynb
└── ...
```


Each week includes:
- 📓 Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step code
- 🧠 Concepts learned and applied
- 📈 Visualizations and results
